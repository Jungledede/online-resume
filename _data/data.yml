    I am looking for new experiences involving system integration, testing and analysis. Traceability, Factory 4.0 and MES are topics that interest me as well.
    NVH is a discipline I discover during the last 8 years. I find it interesting to see how it is perceived as black magic when it can show lot of mechanical and electrical behavior of the DUT, of the structure. It is a subject that I like to popularize.   
    
    I have experience in test bench design and support worldwide, as well as in software development and electrical engineering, and I have gained basic mechanical analysis skills. 
    My drive comes from trying to find the best standard and flexible way to build an architecture. 
    
    Ideally, I would like to live in an area close to the mountains where I can enjoy hiking and cycling in the summer and skiing in the winter, and where the beautiful landscapes change every day. (Target locations: Bielsko-Biala County in Poland or Grenoble in France).

    With Valeo worldwide experience added to movies and games and other cultural media, my English is fluent enough for me to live abroad.
    I started Polish since begin 2025, target is A1 level for next year.

    The self-evaluation section in a resume is a section where you can evaluate and assess your own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. It is typically a short paragraph or bullet points at the end of your resume, which provides a personal perspective on your abilities and how they align with the requirements of the job.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.

    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
